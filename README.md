## About
It's just a repository, for my site, which you can find at [**http://semahawk.heroku.com**](http://semahawk.heroku.com).

## Development
As my site is not completed yet, I am making some changes locally, and pushing them (the changes, of course) to GitHub.
So, as my site, is still in development mode, things here, on GitHub, **are not** the same as things on my Heroku home app. So don't be suprised, if you found some view on GitHub, that should appear on my site. Due to this development mode, you should see just 'Coming soon !' at [**http://semahawk.heroku.com**](http://semahawk.heroku.com).
